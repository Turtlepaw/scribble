This is an opinionated and [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) flavored [scrapboard](https://scrapboard.org) client.

## Why?

### Opinionated Design Philosophy

- **Never use handles**: Handles should be for UI display only. DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) are more permanent and reliable, so they're used for all routing and backend operations
- **Visually appealing**: Every image, component, and interface element should look appealing.
- **Distinctly different**: This app deliberately diverges from Scrapboard.org with UI and features.

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Protocol**: AT Protocol for decentralized social networking
